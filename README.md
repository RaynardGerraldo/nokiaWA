An attempt to have Whatsapp on old Nokia phones

Self Host this please, for your own safety

Notice: Currently working for older versions of ChromeDriver (tested on  131.0.6778.264 and 125).


## Dependencies

- Python
- Flask
- Selenium
## Usage

```
flask --app waweb run

-- go to /login, scan qr code
-- console should output "hey it works" or check "/logged-in", go to /chats after
-- click on any contact you want
-- now you can read and send message

```

Currently a very early version of the program, lack of features but you can send and read messages (no images yet)


## Roadmap

- Scroll down for older messages
- Media support
- And more...

Feel free to contribute :)
